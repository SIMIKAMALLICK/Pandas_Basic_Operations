# File Handling in Python

This project demonstrates basic file handling operations in Python, including reading from files, writing to files, and using the `with` statement for safe file handling.

---

## Features :
1. **Reading from a File**
   - Open a file in read mode.
   - Read a specific number of characters.
   - Read lines with a size hint.
   - Iterate through file content line by line.

2. **Writing to a File**
   - Open a file in write mode.
   - Write single lines or multiple lines.
   - Overwrite existing file content.

3. **Writing a List of Strings**
   - Use `writelines()` to write multiple lines stored in a list.

4. **Using `with open()`**
   - Demonstrates safe file handling using context manager.
   - Automatically closes the file after operations.

##  Files Created:
- `info.txt` - Sample input file (must exist before reading).
- `simika.txt` -  Written with custom text.
- `simika1.txt` - Written with a list of multiple lines.
- `testWrite.txt` - Written using `with open()`.
